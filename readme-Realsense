>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Before running the realsense driver

Install libudev
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

Ensure that the registration data (2048 .bin files) is in [package_location]/data/uvmap/serial/
[Note: The camera will work without this data however the depth registered topics are not published]


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Running the realsense driver

---To run any connected camera feed:
roslaunch realsense_camera realsense_camera_no_rviz.launch


---To run any connected camera feed with rviz showing color, depth, ir, depth cloud, and depth registered cloud feeds
roslaunch realsense_camera realsense_rviz.launch

[Note: The ir feed will require a kernel patch http://bit.ly/1JITy5M . However this is not necessary for the camera operation. ] 


---To run the two cameras individually/concurrently(identified by serial number)
roslaunch realsense_camera realsense1_driver.launch
roslaunch realsense_camera realsense2_driver.launch
