# DO NOT CHANGE THE PARAMETERS' ORDER
# x -> distance from base origin (x axis) to the face of the shelf
# y -> distance from base origin (y axis) to the center of the shelf
# z -> distance from base origin (z axis) to the first shelf of the shelf (internal point)
# roll, pitch and yaw -> rotation with respect to base (in degress; rotation is applied after translation)
# width, height and depth -> related to the cuboid with the target shelfs of the shelf
#   width -> external measurement
#   height -> starting at the internal part of the first shelf and ending at the external part of the last shelf
# xxx_row_heights -> from the internal part of one shelf to the internal part of the next, from botton to top
# xxxx_col_widths -> external measurements
