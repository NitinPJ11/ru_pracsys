# DO NOT CHANGE THE PARAMETERS' ORDER
# x -> distance from base origin (x axis) to the face of the order bin
# y -> distance from base origin (y axis) to the center of the order bin
# z -> distance from base origin (z axis) to the base of the order bin
# roll, pitch and yaw -> rotation with respect to base (in degress; rotation is applied after translation)
# width, height and depth -> related to the cuboid of the order bin (dimensions)
