- The planner fails to find a plan:
  - To move to the origin
  - To move to the bin
  - To move to map
  - To move closer to the object
    -> Implemented solution: Go back to the bin position state and try it all again from this state.
  - To grasp the target object
    -> Implemented solution: Go back to the bin position state and try it all again from this state.
  - To move away from the bin
    -> Implemented solution: Release the object and go back to the bin position state and try it all again from this state.
  - To move to the order bin
  - To grasp the target object
- The planner fails to execute a plan:
  - To move to the origin
  - To move to the bin
  - To move to map
  - To move closer to the object
    -> Implemented solution: Go back to the bin position state and try it all again from this state.
  - To grasp the target object
    -> Implemented solution: Release the object and go back to the bin position state and try it all again from this state.
  - To move away from the bin
    -> Implemented solution: Release the object and go back to the bin position state and try it all again from this state.
  - To move to the order bin
  - To grasp the target object
- The robot trying to grasp an object but missing it, and continuing to complete its task under the assumption that it has a successful grasp.
  -> Suggested solution: Try and avoid it by implementing mechanisms for detecting a grasping failure with very high confidence.
- The robot grasping the wrong object because of faulty recognition or incorrect calibration of the recognition systems.
  -> Suggested solution: Try and avoid it by implementing an object detector with very high confidence.
- The detected object pose is far from a reasonable region that the corresponding bin can be.
  -> Implemented solution: Using the center of the bin coordinates as a hint to the detector so that it does not offer detections 
     too much outside of the bin. 
- The robot picks up multiple objects when it is required to pick a single object.
- The robot drops the object during the transfer process.
  -> Suggested solution: Ignore the event and continue to the next object.
- Some of the software modules stop responding.
  -> Suggested solution: Restart the silent module and change the system state accordingly.
